                    <li>This is significant enough to warrant very strong seasonal marketing strategies.</li>
                    <li>Marketing efforts should be heavily concentrated before peak periods (considering the 97-day booking window).</li>

                <h5>Business Implications:</h5>
                <ul>
                    <li>The 0.42 elasticity means that for every 10% increase in media impressions, travel queries increase by approximately 4.2%.</li>
                    <li>This indicates that media investments drive travel queries with moderate efficiency.</li>
                    <li>The relationship is positive and moderately strong (well above 0.3).</li>
                    <li>Media campaigns will generate positive ROI with reasonable efficiency.</li>
                    <li>Doubling media spend will not double travel queries, but will produce meaningful growth.</li>
                    <li>The moderate elasticity suggests that the South Korea market is reasonably responsive to media campaigns, but other factors also influence travel decisions.</li>
                    <li>This moderate responsiveness suggests that media investments should be complemented by other marketing approaches, such as addressing specific barriers to visitation, particularly the knowledge gap (40%).</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="example">
                <h5>Strategic Example:</h5>
                <p>If you're planning to increase media impressions by 20% for a campaign targeting the South Korean market, you can expect approximately an 8.4% increase in travel queries (20% × 0.42 = 8.4%). This helps set realistic expectations for campaign performance and ROI calculations. Given the 97-day booking window, these increased queries would translate to actual visits approximately 3 months later.</p>

                    <li><strong>Knowledge Gap (40%, +2pp)</strong>: This remains the most significant barrier, indicating a need for increased educational content about Abu Dhabi's offerings. Marketing should focus on raising awareness about the destination's unique experiences and attractions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Previous Visitation (35%, +4pp)</strong>: The increase suggests that many South Korean travelers who have visited Abu Dhabi are not motivated to return. This indicates a need to develop and promote new attractions and experiences to encourage repeat visits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Unfriendly Perception (25%, +2pp)</strong>: This perception issue requires addressing through testimonials and content that showcases the welcoming nature of Abu Dhabi residents and hospitality staff.</li>
                    <li><strong>Children's Entertainment (22%, +7pp)</strong>: This significant increase suggests a growing perception that Abu Dhabi is not family-friendly, despite the presence of numerous family attractions. This misperception needs to be corrected through targeted family-focused marketing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Safety Concerns (22%, +6pp)</strong>: The substantial increase indicates a deteriorating perception of safety that must be addressed through communications highlighting Abu Dhabi's strong safety record and low crime rates.</li>
